This document contains links/descriptions of various
tools/resources I have used for learning languages.
I'll focus on those I have found most useful, as well 
as any popular ones I have tried. 

I'll categorize entries as one of 
1. :partying_face: - great, broadly useful.
2. :neutral_face: - may be situationally useful depending on your background/patience/goals.
3. :rage: - generally a waste of time/effort.

I'll also separate out tools for *Acquisition* - e.g. flash cards, reading practice, 
etc. - from *Reference* - e.g. dictionaries. 

Of course, all opinions are my own, YMMV, especially 
depending on your goals/previous knowledge/learning style.

## General


### Acquisition

| Quality | Link | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| :partying_face: | [Clozemaster](https://clozemaster.com)  | By far the best overall vocab acquisition tool, you need to supply a missing word in a sentence (text-input is better than multiple choice), so you're always learning words in context. Sourced from tatoeba, so quality does vary, but for more common languages generally great. Both web and app available. |
| :partying_face:  | [Anki](https://ankiweb.net)  | "Basic" flashcards. Actually there are a ton of extensions, and generally lots of customization which has a bit of a learning curve, but if you're willing to suffer a bit you can configure a setup (in terms of ui and the spaced repetition logic) that works best for you. The publicly available decks vary a lot in terms of quality, but there are reviews, and maintaining your own decks is pretty easy once you get the hang of it (you can even have [chatgpt](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1915225457) do it for you now...) |
